# Epic 2 - High-Impact Micro-Ad Tile Library

## Purpose
Create fixed-size tiles that instantly convey distinct fantasies and invite interaction before the portal opens.

## Explicit non-goals
- Build the portal expansion system
- Implement preloaders or games
- Establish a shared visual language across tiles

## Target fidelity stage
- Functional

## Primary agent
- Visual Systems Designer

## Reviewers
- UX / Ergonomics Designer
- Frontend Engineer
- Reviewer Proxy

## Goal
Create a set of 200x100 tiles that feel impossibly rich, visually distinct, and interactive. Each tile sells a different fantasy (cyber, candy, magic, vector, glitch).

## Why this exists
These tiles are the bait. They create curiosity and emotional pull before the portal opens.

## Scope
- Fixed-size (200x100) tiles
- Heavy use of CSS illusion techniques
- Unique interaction per tile
- No shared visual language between tiles (on purpose)

## Example tiles
- Candy Overload (Kenney sprites, candy rain)
- Mana Bloom (fractal magic, wisps)
- Hyperlane (Vectrex or vector CRT)
- Glitch Collapse
- Quantum Rift
- Sentient OS

## Acceptance criteria
- Each tile feels unique within 0.5s
- Hover reveals hidden complexity
- Idle state is alive but subtle
- No external rendering engines required
