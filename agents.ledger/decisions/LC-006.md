# Ledger Choice: LC-006 — Obstacle Fairness

## Decision
Obstacles will spawn with a minimum spacing of 300 pixels between them. This ensures that the player always has a clear path to avoid obstacles.

## Rationale
- Prevents perceived unfairness due to unavoidable obstacle clusters.
- Ensures that difficulty progression is earned and not arbitrary.

## Status
Ratified
