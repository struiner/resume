# Ledger Choice: LC-005 — World Motion Model

## Decision
The world will move horizontally at a constant speed, while the player remains stationary in the x-axis. This creates the illusion of the player moving through the world.

## Rationale
- Simplifies collision detection and obstacle spawning logic.
- Provides a clear mental model for the player.

## Status
Ratified
