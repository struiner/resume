# Ledger Choice: LC-003 — Player Jump Eligibility

## Decision
The player can jump only when they are on the ground. Jump eligibility is determined by a rule-based system that checks if the player's position is within a defined threshold of the ground level.

## Rationale
- Ensures consistency and predictability in jump mechanics.
- Prevents perceived bugs where jump inputs are ignored due to positional ambiguity.

## Status
Ratified
